## Personal Information

Let's talk about me. My name is Timothy Potter. I graduated from Iowa State Univerisity in the spring of 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science. I am currently a Dairy clerk a the West Ames Hy-Vee and have been at the store for a little over 4 years now. I am also working part time as a research analyst for PSC, a public research group based out of Iowa Sate University. Some of my hobbies include reading, gaming, playing disc golf, and watching baseball. Sports statistics are a personal passion of mine. Landing a position in the Stats and Analytics department of a professional baseball organization would be a dream job for me. I am an avid weightlifter and spend a significant amount of time and focus on improving my body. Also, at least right now, I'm pretty into mid-2000s pop-punk.

## Course Work

I spent the first three years of my college education as a Software Engineer major. I know a good deal of Java and C, have a strong understanding of software project basics, and know how to figure out what I don't know. As a Data Scientist, I am proficient in R, have a little exposure to things like Python and Machine Learning, and am developing my understanding of statistical methods that will be useful in my career. I excelled academically with a 3.26 cumulative GPA, and am ready to prove myself in the workforce. You can find the rest of my skills in my [resume](tdpotter-resume.pdf).
